Is there any app that can take screenshots of online classes & I don't need to attend it to get screenshots?

AutoShot is the solution.
Now, let the app take online classes, lectures, YouTube videos & webinar screenshots.
Not only the app can take screenshots but also it has more features:
1. it can capture a small portion of the mobile screen
2. you can make pdf of the screenshots from inside the app
3. it also has an option to delete any similar images encountered while taking screenshots
4. all your pdfs are also stored in an organized way & what's more is that you can view from the app itself.
